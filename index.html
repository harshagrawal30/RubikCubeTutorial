  <!--H1-WHAT IS RUBIC CUBE-->
<h4>What is Rubik Cube </h4>
<img src="img/cub-ani.gif" width="50%" alt="" style="float: right;margin-right: -5%;">
<p><b>Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle </b>,each of the six faces was covered by 
nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange,green, 
and yellow. Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use coloured
 plastic panels instead, which prevents peeling and fading.
<br><br>
  In currently sold models, white is opposite yellow, blue is 
  opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white, and blue are 
  arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement.On early cubes, the position 
  of the colours varied from cube to cube. An internal pivot mechanism enables 
  each face to turn independently,thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be
   solved, each face must be returned to have only one .<b>Similar puzzles
    have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers,
     not all of them by Rubik.</b></p>
     <!--H2-HISTORY OF RUBIC CUBE-->
     <h4>History of Rubik Cube</h4>
     <p>In the mid-1970s,<b> Ernő Rubik</b> worked at the Department of Interior Design 
         at the Academy of <b>Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest</b>. Although it is
          widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his
           students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the 
           structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire
            mechanism falling apart. He did not realise that he had created a 
            puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried 
            to restore it. Rubik applied for a patent in Hungary for his
             <b>"Magic Cube" (Bűvös kocka in Hungarian) on 30 January 1975, and
              HU170062 was granted later that year</b>.
              <br><br>
        The first test batches of the Magic Cube were produced in late 1977 and 
        released in Budapest toy shops. Magic Cube was held together with
         interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle being easily pulled
          apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ernő Rubik's
           permission, <b>businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany's Nuremberg 
           Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it</b>. It was 
           noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and they signed a deal with 
           Ideal Toys in September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide. 
           Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark; of course,
            that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was
             renamed after its inventor in 1980. The puzzle made its international
              debut at the toy fairs of London, Paris, Nuremberg, and New York in
               January and February 1980.
               <br><br>
        After its international debut, the progress of the Cube towards the toy 
        shop shelves of the West was briefly halted so that it could be 
        manufactured to Western safety and packaging specifications. A lighter 
        Cube was produced, and Ideal decided to rename it. <b>"The Gordian Knot" and 
        "Inca Gold" were considered, but the company finally decided on "Rubik's
         Cube", and the first batch was exported from Hungary in May 1980.</b></p>
